# Logical Programming Task
First task from the Logical Programming discipline. Interprets and solves the logical equations.

## Students
- Diego Jesus
- Ingrid Pacheco

## Symbols

The available symbols for the logical equations are:

- > ' ➡ ' to 'implies'
- > ' v ' to 'or'
- > ' ^ ' to 'and'
- > ' ~ ' to 'denial'
- > ' [] ' to 'for all'
- > ' <> ' to 'exist'

The equations can be put in the direct way, because the program makes the conversion to polonese notation and executes it.

`Ex: (A v B) ^ C`

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
